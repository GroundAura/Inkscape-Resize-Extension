# Inkscape-Resize-Extension

An Inkscape extension based off the built-in DPI Switcher extension. It's purpose is to quickly resize the document to a desired square pixel size (eg 128 x 128 px), and scale all objects and contents accordingly.

This is my first Inkscape extention, so it may have bugs or inefficiencies. This was created mainly because of a personal need for such a script.
